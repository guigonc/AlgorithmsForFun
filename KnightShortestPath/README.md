Starting on the position 0x0 what is the shortest path to other position on the chess table with NxN.

At first I thought to do some thing with graph algorithms but I saw in some discussions that there where a pattern leading to a 0(1) solution.

So I build this [table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mE20YYxeJ4Xa-8Huzu_18WgHdr-i9fUBvy0I4fFzkoI/edit#gid=0) to help the development.
